# ðŸ§¾ Insurance Claim Classification - Mini Project
ðŸ‘‹ Hello folks! Welcome to this exciting mini-project on Insurance Claim Classification!

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build and compare the performance of multiple machine learning models to predict whether a customer will file a vehicle insurance claim. This classification task helps insurance companies in:

Assessing customer risk profiles

Enhancing underwriting strategies

Optimizing business decisions

We work with a real-world dataset that includes customer features such as:

Age

Vehicle Type

Fuel Type

Region

Subscription Length

Insurance Claim Status (Target Variable)

The models evaluated include:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

AdaBoost

XGBoost

ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
To assess model performance and fairness, we evaluate each classifier based on:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

These metrics help us understand each model's strengths and trade-offs, especially in correctly identifying potential claimants.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
This project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:

pandas â€“ Data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib & seaborn â€“ Data visualization

scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning models and metrics

xgboost â€“ Gradient boosting for classification

numpy â€“ Numerical operations

âœ… Outcome
By comparing model metrics, we identify the most effective classifier for predicting insurance claims. The best-performing model can:

Help insurance firms reduce fraudulent claims

Improve claim handling efficiency

Enhance customer segmentation and pricing strategies

âœ¨ Thank you for exploring this project! We hope it provides useful insights into building classification models for real-world business applications.
